    .\pack.ps1 <file_name> <packed_name> <number of packed>
    file_name: your charp exe file
    packed_name: the output name
    number of packed: the number of packed times more numebr more protected and size will get bigger (10 it's good enough but you can put 100)

# Note that will work on just on charp and console apps
